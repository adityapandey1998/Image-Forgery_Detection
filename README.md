# Description
Detecting tampered images is an important task and one we try to tackle. In this project, we focus on the methods to detect if an image has been tampered with using both Deep Learning and Image transformation methods and comparing the performances and robustness of each method. We then attempt to identify and localize the tampered area of the image and predict the corresponding mask.
